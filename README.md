# Scribbles about draft of series "Road to Web Development".

## Synopsis

The series goes into the history of the internet and how web development has evolved. We will see how the internet used to look back in its infancy, talk abouth legacy technologies, meet entreprenurs, open source contributors etc.

We will then teach how to publish your first thing on the internet, a simple HTML page, getting a domain and then delve deeper into more advanced topics like web servers, templating engines, databases and single page apps.
